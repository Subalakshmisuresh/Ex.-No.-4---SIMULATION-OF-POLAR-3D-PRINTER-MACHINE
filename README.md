## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:

## Assembly of Polar 3D Printer
### 1.	Select 'Assembly of Polar 3D Printer' from the visible list.
### 2.	All the parts related to Polar 3D Printer will be shown on the screen.
### 3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
### 4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
### 5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
### 6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

Y-Axis Base :The Y-axis base in 3D printing plays a vital role in providing stability, guiding movement, ensuring accurate print bed alignment, and incorporating additional features such as heating elements

Z-Axis Base: The x and y axes correspond to the 3D printer's lateral movement, and the z-axis corresponds to vertical movement.

Smooth Rods: Smooth rods play a vital role in ensuring the stability, accuracy, and smooth motion of various components in 3D printers. Their low-friction properties help reduce wear and tear, minimize vibrations, and contribute to high-quality prints

Motors: Motors are responsible for driving the movement of various components, controlling filament feeding, regulating temperature, and achieving precise positioning.

Extruder Supporter: The 3D extruder is the part of the 3D printer that ejects material in liquid or semi-liquid form in order to deposit it in successive layers within the 3D printing volume.

Thread Rod: Threaded rods offer versatility in 3D printing setups. They can be used as a mounting point for additional accessories and add-ons, such as filament spool holders, sensor mounts, or tool heads

Y axis Frame: A well-designed and robust Y-axis frame is crucial for achieving accurate prints, minimizing vibrations, and ensuring the overall performance and reliability of a 3D printer. It provides the foundation for the Y-axis assembly and contributes to the quality and consistency of the printed objects.

Motor With Gear: It's important to note that the specific use of motors with gears may vary depending on the design and configuration of the 3D printer. Different printers may implement different motor types, such as stepper motors or servo motors, depending on the desired level of control and precision

Motor with Pulley: Different printers may implement different motor types, such as stepper motors or servo motors, depending on the desired level of control and precision. Additionally, the pulley size and ratio can be adjusted to achieve the desired speed and torque requirements for specific printer applications.

Gears: Gears provide mechanical advantage, precise motion control, and help in achieving accurate and high-quality prints. The specific use of gears may vary depending on the printer's design, configuration, and motion system.

Plate: The use of plates in 3D printing can vary depending on the printer's design and configuration. Different printers may utilize various plate materials, surface treatments, and heating mechanisms to optimize adhesion and print quality.

Extruder:An extruder is simply the machine used to complete the extrusion process. Using a system of barrels and cylinders, the machine heats up the product and propels it through the die to create the desired shape.

Filament: the filament materials used in 3D printing. There are many other specialized filaments available in the market, each with unique properties and suitable for specific applications.
